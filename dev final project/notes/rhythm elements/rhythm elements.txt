- interval-based fishing, have to hold for at least 70-80% of interval to succeed

- each rarity of fish has a different interval 
- (backup plan) set interval for all fish, but the fish you get depends on the %
of the interval you held for


- audio-wise, if using different rarity intervals, choose a song with varying bpm
- ^ otherwise use song with more consistent bpm


- when you're about to get a bite, sound will slowly fade in to indicate presence of fish
- sound gets to full volume + some visual indicator to show player should start pressing

- player won't know how long the interval is, it's indicated by sound
-- when interval is ending, sound will fade/bpm manipulation

- player has to hold for majority of the interval to successfully get the fish 
-- it will be possible to hold too long (and fail to fish up higher rarity fish) 
-- or not hold long enough (and fail to fish up lower rarity fish)
-- if you hold for way too short/long you'll miss most types of fish
