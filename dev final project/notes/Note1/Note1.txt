most of the code will probably be based in the player? 

player begins in static state, textbox appears saying "i should fish" 
- will probably be popup style textboxes as in narr game clone 

after button pressed, turns around 

when catching fish, there will likely be a random number generated and then fed into a function that
creates + assigns fish rarity + fish sprites

things needed
-placeholder sprites for player animations, fish, boat, water
	- fish sprites go in the fish folder, since there'll be a lot 
-placeholder sfx?? idk i usually add those at the end 




this is just hypothetical 
if we wanted to make a "fish catalog" i could look up and see if we could do something like an rpgmaker
event map (is it called bitmapping??) where you can designate areas on a premade image that will do diff things
when hovered/clicked
